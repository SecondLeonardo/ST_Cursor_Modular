You're asking a **very important** and very big question, so let's break it down clearly and simply. You want to build a social media app (like SkillTalk), and you’re wondering:

* ✅ What **regulations** apply in the **EU**?
* ✅ What **Apple** and **Google/Android** expect?
* ✅ What **requirements** an app must meet to be accepted (on app stores)?
* ✅ And you're starting from scratch, so you want a **full overview**.

## 🌍 1. EU Regulations for Social Media Apps

If you offer your app in **Europe**, these are the **main regulations** you **must follow**:

### ✅ A. **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)

* The most important law in the EU.
* Applies to **all apps** that collect **personal data** from users in Europe.

You MUST:

* Ask for **explicit consent** to collect data.
* Allow users to **access, delete, and export** their data.
* Have a clear **Privacy Policy**.
* Securely store and transmit personal data (e.g., encrypt it).
* Get **parental consent** for users under 16 in many countries.
* Appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** if needed (depends on your app scale).

### ✅ B. **DSA** (Digital Services Act) – since 2024

* Targets platforms like SkillTalk.
* You must:

  * Allow users to **report illegal content**.
  * Respond **quickly to reports** and give feedback.
  * Be **transparent** about algorithms (e.g., match or feed sorting).
  * Let users control **personalized content/recommendations**.
  * Prevent harmful or misleading information from spreading.
  * Allow **opt-out from algorithmic recommendations**.

### ✅ C. **ePrivacy Directive** (Cookie Law)

* Applies if your app stores or accesses info on the device (e.g., cookies, analytics).
* You must get **consent for tracking** (like Firebase Analytics or ads).

## 🍏 2. Apple App Store Regulations

Apple has strict rules. If your app violates any of these, it will be **rejected**.

### 📘 Apple’s Guidelines:

Key points:

### ✅ Security

### ✅ Content

* If under 13: follow **COPPA** (US law, applies globally in practice).

### ✅ In-App Purchases

* You **must use Apple’s payment system** for digital goods (coins, gifts, VIP).
* Can’t use PayPal, Stripe, etc. for digital items.

## 🤖 3. Google Play Store (Android) Regulations

Google’s rules are very similar to Apple’s, but a bit more relaxed.

### 📘 Google Policy Center:
