Generally solid — black text on white background. Some gray text (e.g., “joined for 20 days”) could be harder to read for low-vision users.
Consistent Layout
All cards/modules follow similar design language and spacing.
Icon Clarity
Visually intuitive with clear meanings (headphones for audio, book for library, flame for streak, etc.).
Accessibility Options
No toggle for font size/dark mode shown directly — likely hidden in the settings gear.
Gamification cues
Use of streaks, points, and badges drives user retention and regular usage.
