How to become a teacher or make a course in SkilTalk

Let's dive into a detailed UI/UX analysis of the “How can I apply to be a verified teacher on SkillTalk?” help page.

🔍 1. Full UI/UX Breakdown
🔸 Design Elements
Typography


The question header ("How can I apply…") uses a light gray font in a larger size, indicating a secondary heading—it's visible but not dominant.


The body text is black and uses a clean, sans-serif font for readability.


The email (teacher@SkillTalk.com) is colored blue and underlined, identifying it as a clickable link (conventional hyperlink behavior).


Layout


Top Navigation:


A back arrow in the upper left allows the user to return to the previous page.


The word “FAQ” is centered and bolded, establishing context clearly.


Main Content Area:


Text is left-aligned for easy scanning.


Paragraph breaks improve readability.


Bottom Section:


Includes a “Was this helpful?” prompt with thumbs up/down buttons, supporting feedback interaction.


Colors


Neutral palette: Mostly black/gray text on white background ensures clarity.


Accent color: Blue is used for actionable elements (email link), following conventional UX standards.


Feedback buttons are gray, implying a secondary action and not the primary focus of the page.


Shapes & Icons


Rounded rectangular buttons (Yes/No) are visually soft and touch-friendly.


Thumb icons are recognizable and intuitive.



🔸 Structure & Hierarchy
Visual Hierarchy


Back Arrow + FAQ Title – Navigation clarity.


Question in gray – The user knows what the content will address.


Instructional Text – The meat of the content, center-aligned and easy to skim.


Email Call-to-Action – Clear next step.


Feedback Prompt – Optional user input at the end.


Content Hierarchy


Intro → Required materials → Preferred extras → Next steps → Feedback.


This sequence supports progressive disclosure, helping users take action with minimal friction.



🔸 Usability & Accessibility
Strengths:


Concise and direct language.


Email is clearly presented and tappable.


Feedback buttons offer user engagement without clutter.


Mobile-friendly spacing and touch targets.


Areas for Improvement:


Accessibility: Light gray text (header) might not meet WCAG contrast standards, especially for visually impaired users.


Voice-over support: There’s no indication of ARIA labels or screen reader support in the design (this would depend on the backend implementation).


No visual confirmation after feedback submission — adding a “Thanks for your feedback!” could enhance UX.


Could benefit from a progress indicator or checklist UI showing step-by-step how to become a teacher.

🔸 Purpose of Metrics (If Applicable)
In this specific screen, no direct metrics such as "gifts income," "events hosted," or "audience totals" are shown. However, in the broader SkillTalk app (particularly for verified teachers), these metrics might serve the following purposes:
Metric
Likely Purpose
Gifts Income
Monetization insights, showing how much value users have earned from student interactions.
Events Hosted

These are more likely to appear on a teacher dashboard rather than in the help page itself.

Break instructions into bullet points for easier skimming.


Include icons or micro-illustrations for each step (resume, audio, schedule).
