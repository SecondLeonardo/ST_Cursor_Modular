• Hide this user’s Posts (toggle)
• Don’t show my Posts (toggle)
• Receive Voice Calls (toggle ON)
• Clear Chat History (with trash bin icon)
• Purpose: Keeps context visible while clearly emphasizing the modal dialog.

2. Modal Popup (Foreground Layer)
• Style: Rounded-top white modal sheet with drop shadow.

ACCESSIBILITY NOTES
