Introduction about myself
I have a complete idea for an application. I don‚Äôt know anything about coding. I don't want to learn either. But I want artificial intelligence to write the codes for me.

App definition
SkillTalk ‚Äì App Purpose
SkillTalk is a platform designed to connect people based on complementary skills.
 The goal is to match users with skill partners whose areas of expertise align with the skills they target to learn, and vice versa.
In other words, if User A wants to learn a skill that User B is proficient in, and User B wants to learn a skill that User A excels at, SkillTalk brings them together for mutual skill exchange and learning.

Artificial intelligence duties:
Fix all of my mistakes in dictate
fix all of the capital/small letters that is need to be fixed
Write all the privacy policy and licence
Write all the licence
Find out all o f the futures and functionalities that are in the ui/ux design elements provided in this text, but i didn't write those required functionalities.
Write all of the skills with different categories for the entrance registration of the app
Write all of the different parts of the help articles and put them inside the app
component list + Figma export style spec
Chat module logic (including media permissions behavior)
UX flow diagram for this interaction
A UI wireframe version of this emoji drawer
Design specs (spacing, sizing, layout units)
Component naming convention for dev handoff (e.g., EmojiTab, StickerTile)
Make a list of all of the interest and hobbies in different categories 
Make a list of all of the occupations in different categories
Write the help articles of the app


The Key Problems SkillTalk Solves
üåê Connecting people with complementary skills
 Bridging the gap between learners and experts by matching users who can mutually benefit from each other's knowledge.


üéì Helping learners find coaches and mentors
 SkillTalk makes it easy for users to discover people who can teach them practical, real-world skills ‚Äî whether informally or through structured guidance.


üßë‚Äçüè´ Helping professional teachers and tutors find students
 Qualified instructors can showcase their expertise, attract learners, and even offer paid lessons through the platform.


ü§ù Finding long-term learning partners
 Users can build consistent, peer-based learning relationships with others who share their learning goals or can teach what they seek to master.


üåç Connecting subject matter experts across borders
 Experts can share their skills with learners around the world, breaking the limitations of geography.


üí¨ Facilitating peer-to-peer skill exchange
 Unlike traditional platforms that are one-directional (teacher-to-student), SkillTalk emphasizes reciprocal learning where both parties grow.



App technology
swift is the technology used for built this app, A combination of both - **SwiftUI for the core UI** and **UIKit for complex parts like chat, voiceroom, and media playback**

build in a MVVM architecture:
. **Architecture:** Use MVVM architecture, which works great with SwiftUI.

 **iOS:**
- Core UI parts with SwiftUI (profile, settings, matching list, posts)
- Complex parts with UIKit (chat, voiceroom, media player)


. It makes the work easier. First we want  to make it for IOS  then we will make android version.
Target Audience:
SkillTalk is designed for everyone, but it especially resonates with:
üéØ Individuals seeking personal or professional growth through coaching, mentorship, or skill exchange


üë®‚Äçüè´ Learners looking for real-world education beyond traditional institutions


üíº Professionals wanting to build connections aligned with their career paths or business goals


ü§ù People eager to form meaningful relationships based on shared interests and complementary skills


üßë‚Äçüéì Students and job seekers exploring mentorship and career-oriented conversations


üë©‚Äçüíª Freelancers, creatives, and specialists who want to share their expertise while learning from others


Whether someone is looking for a coach, a student, a peer to grow with, or just someone who "gets it" ‚Äî SkillTalk brings them together in a purposeful way.

User flow pages: (Onboarding & Sign-Up)

1- Welcome page
here is a breakdown of the UI/UX design and functionality of the SkillTalk app‚Äôs welcome and login page:
UI/UX Design and Functionality Analysis:
1. Layout & Structure:
‚Ä¢ The design is clean, structured, and user-friendly with a focus on Skill exchange.
‚Ä¢ The top section prominently displays the app‚Äôs name, ‚ÄúSkillTalk‚Äù, in a bold blue-to-Teal gradient color.
‚Ä¢ Below, the tagline ‚ÄúTo the World‚Äù is in large black font, emphasizing the global aspect of the app.
‚Ä¢ Supporting text in smaller font highlights key features: ‚ÄúPractice 150+ Skill‚Äù and ‚ÄúMeet 50 mil global friends‚Äù, with numerical values in a light blue color for emphasis.
2. Visual & Color Elements:
‚Ä¢ The background is a gradient of light Teal and white, giving a soft, welcoming look.
‚Ä¢ Text is in a combination of black, blue, and Teal to maintain contrast and readability.
‚Ä¢ The buttons and icons use recognizable brand colors (Apple, Google, Facebook, KakaoTalk) for intuitive interaction.
3. Functional Elements (Buttons, Icons, Interactive Elements):
‚Ä¢ Sign-in Options:
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúSign in with Apple‚Äù is the largest button, placed centrally to prioritize ease of access for Apple users.
‚Ä¢ Below it, there are icons for Google, Facebook, Email, and KakaoTalk, offering multiple sign-in methods.
‚Ä¢ A ‚ÄúMore‚Äù (three dots) button suggests additional login options.
‚Ä¢ Language Greeting Bubbles:
‚Ä¢ Various greeting messages appear in speech bubbles with user avatars and country flags.
‚Ä¢ Each greeting is displayed in a different language (e.g., English, Korean, Chinese, French, Arabic, etc.).
‚Ä¢ This enhances the app‚Äôs international and inclusive theme.
‚Ä¢ Help Section:
‚Ä¢ Below the login options, a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having trouble signing in‚Äù link provides support for users facing issues.
4. Interaction Flow & User Experience:
‚Ä¢ Tapping ‚ÄúSign in with Apple‚Äù triggers a dark overlay with an Apple ID sign-in prompt (seen in the second image).
‚Ä¢ This modal popup is smoothly integrated into the UI for a seamless sign-in experience.
‚Ä¢ Other login options (Google, Facebook, Email, KakaoTalk) likely lead to their respective authentication flows.
5. Accessibility & Usability:
‚Ä¢ Clear call-to-action buttons make navigation simple.
‚Ä¢ High contrast text ensures readability.
‚Ä¢ Multiple sign-in options cater to different user preferences.
