Introduction about myself
I have a complete idea for an application. I don’t know anything about coding. I don't want to learn either. But I want artificial intelligence to write the codes for me.

App definition
SkillTalk – App Purpose
SkillTalk is a platform designed to connect people based on complementary skills.
 The goal is to match users with skill partners whose areas of expertise align with the skills they target to learn, and vice versa.
In other words, if User A wants to learn a skill that User B is proficient in, and User B wants to learn a skill that User A excels at, SkillTalk brings them together for mutual skill exchange and learning.

Artificial intelligence duties:
Fix all of my mistakes in dictate
fix all of the capital/small letters that is need to be fixed
Write all the privacy policy and licence
Write all the licence
Find out all o f the futures and functionalities that are in the ui/ux design elements provided in this text, but i didn't write those required functionalities.
Write all of the skills with different categories for the entrance registration of the app
Write all of the different parts of the help articles and put them inside the app
component list + Figma export style spec
Chat module logic (including media permissions behavior)
UX flow diagram for this interaction
A UI wireframe version of this emoji drawer
Design specs (spacing, sizing, layout units)
Component naming convention for dev handoff (e.g., EmojiTab, StickerTile)
Make a list of all of the interest and hobbies in different categories 
Make a list of all of the occupations in different categories
Write the help articles of the app


The Key Problems SkillTalk Solves
🌐 Connecting people with complementary skills
 Bridging the gap between learners and experts by matching users who can mutually benefit from each other's knowledge.


🎓 Helping learners find coaches and mentors
 SkillTalk makes it easy for users to discover people who can teach them practical, real-world skills — whether informally or through structured guidance.


🧑‍🏫 Helping professional teachers and tutors find students
 Qualified instructors can showcase their expertise, attract learners, and even offer paid lessons through the platform.


🤝 Finding long-term learning partners

🌍 Connecting subject matter experts across borders
 Experts can share their skills with learners around the world, breaking the limitations of geography.


💬 Facilitating peer-to-peer skill exchange
 Unlike traditional platforms that are one-directional (teacher-to-student), SkillTalk emphasizes reciprocal learning where both parties grow.



App technology
Fluter is the technology used for built this app, because we can have one code for IOS, Android, Web and desktop. It makes the work easier. First we want  to make it for IOS android then we will make desktop and web version.
Target Audience:

🎯 Individuals seeking personal or professional growth through coaching, mentorship, or skill exchange

🤝 People eager to form meaningful relationships based on shared interests and complementary skills


🧑‍🎓 Students and job seekers exploring mentorship and career-oriented conversations
