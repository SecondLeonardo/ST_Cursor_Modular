Icons
Limited but purposeful. ‚Äú?‚Äù icon could use a hover tooltip or screen-reader description.
Color dependency
The ‚Äúselected‚Äù state relies heavily on color (orange), which may affect colorblind users. Consider adding icons (‚úîÔ∏è) or bold outlines.
Font size
Mostly legible, though the price/session font could be slightly larger for clarity.


‚öôÔ∏è 2. Functionality Explanation

Shapes
Card-style elements with rounded corners ‚Äî modern, mobile-friendly. The coin amount selector buttons are pill-shaped with soft glowing borders for the first one.
Typography

‚ôø Usability & Accessibility
Feature
UX Evaluation
Tappable Elements
Coin cards and CTA button are large and thumb-friendly. Clear visual feedback (colors, outlines) on selection.
Text Readability
Excellent contrast for titles and calls-to-action. However, some smaller grey legal text may be harder to read for users with visual impairments.
Emotional Cues
Gamification + animation = engaging UX.
Exit Strategy
No visible close (‚ÄòX‚Äô) button, though tapping outside may dismiss it ‚Äî a potential UX issue.
Onboarding Clarity
First-time users may not fully understand what ‚ÄúStarry‚Äù or ‚Äú1-hour cap‚Äù rewards are ‚Äî these could use hover or tapable tooltips.
